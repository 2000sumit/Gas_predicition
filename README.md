# Natural Gas Price Forecasting

## **Description**
This project demonstrates a simple forecasting model for predicting natural gas prices based on historical data. The program uses linear regression to fit the historical prices and predicts future prices. It also includes a function to predict the price of natural gas for any given date.

---

## **Features**
- Visualize historical natural gas prices.
- Fit a linear regression model to historical data.
- Forecast natural gas prices for future dates.
- Predict the price of natural gas for a specific date.

---

## **Dataset**
The project uses a dataset (`Nat_Gas.csv`) with the following columns:
1. **Dates**: Dates in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.
2. **Prices**: Natural gas prices corresponding to the dates.

---

## **Dependencies**
This project uses the following Python libraries:
- `pandas` for data manipulation.
- `datetime` for date handling.
- `scikit-learn` for linear regression modeling.
- `numpy` for numerical operations.
- `matplotlib` for visualization.

Install the dependencies using:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy matplotlib
